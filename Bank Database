/*IÂ´ll be querying a bank database to see which product is the best option for a certain customer*/


/*This customer is interested in opening a Checking or Savings account, but wants more information on the options.*/
/*Here I wrote a query that uses OR to show the product names that have a Checking OR Savings product type.*/
SELECT product_name, product_type
FROM bank_products
WHERE product_type = 'Savings'
OR product_type = 'Checking';

/*Now the customer decided they want a savings account with a good interest rate and no monthly fee*/
/* Here I wrote a query that uses AND to show the product names that have a "Savings" product type AND have an interest_rate of at least 0.75, AND have no monthly fee.*/
SELECT product_name, product_type, interest_rate, monthly_fee
FROM bank_products
WHERE product_type = 'Savings' 
AND interest_rate >= 0.75
