# Carlos MendozaÂ´s SQL Portfolio 

## Welcome to my SQL portfolio!
This code repository contains examples of SQL that I have written. In this portfolio, you will find examples of my skills in database design, querying, and manipulation using SQL.

The examples cover a range of topics including creating tables, inserting data, updating records, selecting and filtering data, and using aggregate functions. Each example includes comments explaining the purpose and functionality of the code.

Feel free to browse the examples and reach out to my email if you have any questions or feedback. Thank you for visiting!
